Allows handing in streaming data from e.g.\n   connect.js. (github.com/englercj)\n - Only set the language attribute on map and reduce phases. Avoid setting it on\n   phases where it's not according to spec. (github.com/accelerated)\n\n#### 0.9.3\n  \n - Switch testing framework to mocha/should.js (github.com/kenperkins)\n - Remove requirement of a Unix system from package.json (github.com/yawnt)\n - Fix a global leak of HttpSearchMeta (github.com/brianedgerton)\n\n#### 0.9.2\n\n - Fix Search options so it handles hostname and port (github.com/kenperkins)\n - Fix unwanted vector clock overwriting during link walking (github.com/TauZero)\n - Handle connection errors gracefully so that they don't kill the process\n\n#### 0.9.1\n\n - Request instrumentation for metrics, logging, etc.\n - Fix a leak in Httpmeta (github.com/rkusa), (#134)\n - Handle content length properly for Unicode data (#132)\n - Fix MapReduce options so it handles hostname and port (github.com/spencergibb)\n - Add support for link-walking (github.com/TauZero) \n - Handle JSONified error messages (github.com/spencergibb)\n - Fix parsing of links on get requests (github.com/TauZero)\n\n#### 0.9.0\n\n - Complete rewrite in JavaScript (two reasons: better debugging in production deployments, and more people can contribute)\n - Support Riak 1.0 features\n - First class support for streams (Luwak, key listing, Map/Reduce, logging)\n - Faster testing with node-seq + assert\n - Extra HTTP headers can now be passed in via `headers` (for instance custom usermeta, `X-Riak-Meta-*`) - these *will* override whatever has been set elsewhere\n - `addSearch` is now `search`\n - The project is open for other implementations\n - Removed Protocol Buffers support – contributions welcome (extend `Client` in a file called `protobuf-client.js` along with a `protobuf-meta.js`)\n - A client-side impl is also possible (look at https://github.com/ded/reqwest)\n - Support for Riak Search, including adding and removing documents directly.\n   Search is namespaced on the client separately: `riak.search.find('users',\n   'email:test@example.com')`\n - Moved MapReduce to a separate namespace on the client to separate concerns in\n   a nicer way: `riak.mapreduce.add('users').run()`\n\n##### TODO\n\n - Unify `meta` in all responses (check `getAll`, chunked map/reduce) - meta should allow for fine-grained mappings\n - SSL support\n - Use path internally but don't expose it as API (see `path` branch), to prepare for new URIs in Riak 1.0\n - More rigorous test suite (port from master)\n\n##### LATER\n - Integrate test backend\n \n#### 0.4.1\n\n - Add search params [gpascale]\n - SSL client [isaacs]\n - Last-modified date patch [siculars]\n - Add `meta.noError404` so that you can prevent 404s from showing up as errors [syrio]\n - Deprecation warnings\n\n#### 0.4.0\n\n - `db.update`: convenience method for updating documents\n - Changed debug behaviour: always log to stdout. Not providing a callback **will** output to `console.log` regardless of the setting\n\n#### 0.4.0rc3\n\n - Allow headers to override, useful for reverse proxies sitting between node and Riak\n - URI-encoding bucket/key is now an option (encodeUri)\n - Add documentation for map/reduce arguments\n - Remove agent from meta, which should fix critical bug (#64, #67)\n - Allow logging to alternate streams. And default to stderr, not stdout (thanks Mark!)\n - Add docs for host/port (thanks Ken!)\n - Add the new `presort` property for Riak Search (thanks Greg!)\n\n#### 0.4.0rc2\n\n - Major docs update => [http://riak-js.org](http://riak-js.org)\n - `keys=stream` emits `keys` events\n - `walk` now accepts `noJSON`\n - Support Map/Reduce timeout option\n - Protobuf interface refactor (still experimental support in 0.4)\n - Minor bug fixes\n\n#### 0.4.0rc1\n\n - node 0.4.x compatibility\n - npm 1.0 compatibility\n - Minor bug fixes\n\n#### 0.3.6\n\n - Fix index.js and package.json for npm compat\n - Fix recursing usermeta\n - Fix for luwak location parsing\n - Updates related to Riak Search operations\n\n#### 0.3.0beta6\n\n - Test backend implementation\n - Connect session store\n - Protobuf parsing is now more robust\n - Replace client every time ECONNREFUSED occurs\n - Initial Riak Search support\n - Minor bugfixing and internals refactoring\n\n#### 0.3.0beta5\n\n - Add support for bucket listing in HTTP (new Riak 0.14 feature)\n - Updated to CoffeeScript 1.0.0\n - Fixed a memory leak caused by adding too many Event Listeners\n - If there's no `vclock` present in a Meta, do not send any `clientId`\n\n\n### License\n\nSimplified BSD License\n\nCopyright 2011 Francisco Treacy.
