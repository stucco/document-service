It's been tested very thoroughly in our environment and for our usage patterns, but\nthere may be glaring holes in functionality that we don't use.\n\nIt uses the \"poolee\" module to do load balancing and failure detection so you don't necessarily need a load balancer between node\nand Riak.\n\nThe library has support for timing each request, resolving siblings, and conditional retry.\n\n## API\n\n### Constructor\n\n    var RiakClient = require(\"riak\"), client;\n    client = new RiakClient([\"host1:port1\", \"host2:port2\", ... \"hostn:portn\"], \"client_id\", \"pool_name\");\n\nThe `RiakClient` constructor takes a list of host:port pairs, each of which are equivalent nodes in a Riak cluster.\n\n## Example\n\nThere is no documentation yet, and there is only one example.  This is the best thing to look at for now.  You can run it, and you should see something like this:\n\n    ranney-imac:~/work/node_riak (master)$ curl -X DELETE localhost:8098/riak/bucket_1/key_1\n    ranney-imac:~/work/node_riak (master)$ node example.js \n    metric: counter, riak_retry_filter|404_GET=1\n    metric: histogram, LB_Pool_pool_name|GET|bucket_1=51\n    metric: histogram, LB_Pool_pool_name|PUT|bucket_1=7\n    204:  { counter: 1 }\n    ranney-imac:~/work/node_riak (master)$ node example.js \n    metric: histogram, LB_Pool_pool_name|GET|bucket_1=9\n    metric: histogram, LB_Pool_pool_name|PUT|bucket_1=5\n    204:  { counter: 2 }\n    ranney-imac:~/work/node_riak (master)$ node example.js \n    metric: histogram, LB_Pool_pool_name|GET|bucket_1=9\n    metric: histogram, LB_Pool_pool_name|PUT|bucket_1=4\n    204:  { counter: 3 }\n\n## LICENSE - \"MIT License\"\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Matthew Ranney, http://ranney.com/\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
